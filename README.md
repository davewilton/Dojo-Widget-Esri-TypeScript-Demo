[Demo](https://rawgit.com/davewilton/Dojo-Widget-Esri-TypeScript-Demo/master/SampleDojoTypeScriptApp/index.html)



## Development

Locally hosted versions of the Esri Library can be used for development

[grunt-esri-slurp](https://github.com/steveoh/grunt-esri-slurp) and [bower](http://bower.io/) to download the dojo & esri libraries

To install the esri and dojo dependencies once bower is installed change directory to Dojo-Widget-Esri-TypeScript-Demo:

```shell
npm install
```

The index.html will need to be pointed at the locally hosted version. Also make edits to init.js as per comments.
